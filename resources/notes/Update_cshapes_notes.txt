in cshapes0.4-2 the cutoff date is 6/30/2012
*note that this will create data that may have some accuracies if there have been country changes between the cshapes cutoff date and the iwp date
update these records to current year. E.G. for 2013 update to 
COWEYEAR=2013
COWEMONTH=12
COWEDAY=31

UPDATE cshapes SET COWEYEAR=2013, COWEMONTH=12, COWEDAY=31
WHERE COWEYEAR = 2012 AND COWEMONTH=6 AND COWEDAY=30

Update invalid date (-1) on Yugoslavia COW dates to values in corresponding GW Dates columns

---
Add 2 date columns to the end of the cshapes table
cowsdate
cowedate

ALTER TABLE cshapes ADD COLUMN cowsdate date;
ALTER TABLE cshapes ADD COLUMN cowedate date;

update these to date formed by individual columns

UPDATE cshapes SET cowsdate = to_date(cowsyear::text||'-'||cowsmonth::text||'-'||cowsday::text,'YYYY-MM-DD');
UPDATE cshapes SET cowedate = to_date(coweyear::text||'-'||cowemonth::text||'-'||coweday::text,'YYYY-MM-DD');

to_date()

SELECT to_char(mydate, 'YYYY-MM') || '-25' AS text_value, 
date_trunc('MONTH', mydate)::date + 24 AS date_value
